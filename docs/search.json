I would love to blog more, but, for the moment, ideas are mostly in my head.\nand who am I?\n\nMy name is Luisa M. Mimmi. I was born and raised in Italy, but I spent 14 years in the US based in Washington DC, working for multilateral development banks. Upon returning to Italy, I have been working as policy analyst for Italian government agencies.\nI am passionate about using data to understand and tackle various dimensions of economic development, my main professional focus, so far, has been on policies to provide essential housing and infrastructure services.\nFor more details about my ‘official’ job see my CV (in English)/CV (in Italian)\n\n\n\n\n",

It contains the html files that are created from your Rmd files. Those files will be used by Github to display your website\nmore content…. all you need to do is edit existing or create new R Markdown (.Rmd) files (or,)if you don’t use R code in your file, you could just use plain Markdown/md files)\nHow to generate local version\nFrom the Build pane, clicking on Build Website hammer icon\nType rmarkdown::render_site(encoding = 'UTF-8') into the R console. This will:\nRender all .Rmd and ,md files in the root dir into HTML (EXCEPT markdown files beginning with “_” )\nRegenerate Blog posts\ncopy the generated HTML files in the output dir (_site/* or docs/*) along with supporting files (e.g. CSS and JavaScript)\n\nHow to add a blog post\ncreate it distill::create_post(title = \"prova\", collection = \"posts\", author = \"auto\", slug = \"auto\", date = Sys.Date(), draft = TRUE)\nknit it or run rmarkdown::render(\"_posts/2022-04-13-prova/prova.Rmd\") (posts are considered standalone documents that are not re-rendered when the site is built)\nbuild site\nPublication page\nI imitate the smart model of Joel Nitta. To make it work, I had to figure out a few tweaks:\nSome type of my bib entries from Zotero were not being exported, but you can add in Zotero an “extra” field. see instructions here.\nAdding in in Extra tex.referencetype: proceedings –> makes the bibtex key become @proceedings{g20-italy_g20_2021, ...\nAdding in in Extra tex.type: conference Proceedings –> makes the bibtex key become @proc ..., type = {conferenceProceedings},....\n\nIn the functions I had to replace if (is.na (url)) return(NULL) (error when knit ) with -> if (anyNA(url)) return(NULL)\nadding ./header.html allows to use the Academicons icons (only fontawesome ones are inthe distill website by default)\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis is possible thanks to the fantastic R package distill. I started from this tutorial -Here’s another nice tutorial. Then I ‘borrowed’ the solution of Quang Nguyen to design the Project page and from Joel Nitta’s website for the theme and publication page. Here’s another nice example and, possibly for later, plus tutorial blog).\n\n\n\n",
