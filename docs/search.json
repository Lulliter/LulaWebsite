I was born and raised in Italy, although I spent 14 years in the US based in Washington, DC. working for multilateral development banks. Upon returning to Italy, I have been working as policy analyst advisor for the Italian government.\nI am passionate about using data to understand and tackle various dimensions of economic development, with a focus on the provision of essential housing and infrastructure services.\nFor more details about my ‘official’ job see my CV (English)/CV (Italian)\n\n\n\n\n",

This will:\nRender all .Rmd and ,md files in the root dir into HTML (EXCEPT markdown files beginning with “_” )\nRegenerate Blog posts\ncopy the generated HTML files in the output dir (_site/* or docs/*) along with supporting files (e.g. CSS and JavaScript)\n\nStructure\nThe file ./index.Rmd = the main landing page of your website | fill it with the content you want on your main page.\nThe file ./_site.yml = (called a YAML file) contains the main settings for your site that control the overall look.\n  + this include what files are included and excluded from the site\nThe ./docs/* (or _site/*) folder = created and updated when you build the website. It contains the html files that are created from your Rmd files. Those files will be used by Github to display your website\nmore content…. all you need to do is edit existing or create new R Markdown (.Rmd) files (or,)if you don’t use R code in your file, you could just use plain Markdown/md files)\nHow to add a blog post\ncreate it distill::create_post(title = \"prova\", collection = \"posts\", author = \"auto\", slug = \"auto\", date = Sys.Date(), draft = TRUE)\nknit it or run rmarkdown::render(\"_posts/2022-04-13-prova/prova.Rmd\") (posts are considered standalone documents that are not re-rendered when the site is built)\nbuild site\nPublication page\nTo imitate the model of John Helvy, I had to change the type of my bib entries from Zotero. Some where not being exported. So I figure out that you can add in Zotero an d“extra” field. see intr here\nAdding in in Extra tex.referencetype: proceedings –> makes the bibtex key become @proceedings{g20-italy_g20_2021, ...\nAdding in in Extra tex.type: conference Proceedings –> makes the bibtex key become @proc ..., type = {conferenceProceedings},....\nAcknowledgements\nI started from this great tutorial; borrowed the solution of Quang Nguyen to design the Project page; took ‘inspiration’ from Joel Nitta’s website for the theme. Here’s another nice example for later (with tutorial blog).\n\n\n\n",
