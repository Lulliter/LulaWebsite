### ... me  
<!-- _`whoami`_ -->
My name is **Luisa M. Mimmi**. I was born and raised in Italy, although I spent 14 years in the US based in Washington, DC. working for multilateral development banks. 

I am passionate about using data to understand and tackle various dimensions of economic development, with a focus on the provision of essential housing and infrastructure services. 

For more details about my 'official' job see my [**CV (English)**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lulliter/cv/master/01_CV_Rmarkdown/Luisa-M-Mimmi_CV.pdf) or [**CV (Italian)**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lulliter/cv/master/02_CV_Rmarkdown_ITA/Luisa-M-Mimmi_CV_ITA.pdf)

### ... and this website

This is intended as a place to collect notes-to-self, `r fontawesome::fa("r-project", fill = "#5F85A7")` code snippets, half-baked ideas, and side-projects that stay tenaciously planted on my "To-Do" list.
